## Install patch (Civ 5)

#### Linux (native)

Open a terminal and run this command:

```
sed -i 's/SELECT ModID from Mods where Activated = 1/SELECT ModID from Mods where Activated = 2/' "/home/$USER/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/Sid Meier's Civilization V/Civ5XP"
```

#### Linux (Proton)

Use the provided patch script to patch the binaries, e.g.

```
./scripts/apply-patch.sh "/home/$USER/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/Sid Meier's Civilization V/CivilizationV.exe"
./scripts/apply-patch.sh "/home/$USER/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/Sid Meier's Civilization V/CivilizationV_DX11.exe"
./scripts/apply-patch.sh "/home/$USER/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/Sid Meier's Civilization V/CivilizationV_Tablet.exe"
```

```

#### Windows

1. Download the patch tool from [Releases](https://github.com/bmaupin/civ5-cheevos-with-mods/releases)

1. Extract the patch tool using 7zip

1. Run the patch tool, e.g.

```
patch-civ5.exe 'C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Sid Meier''s Civilization V\CivilizationV.exe'
patch-civ5.exe 'C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Sid Meier''s Civilization V\CivilizationV_DX11.exe'
patch-civ5.exe 'C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Sid Meier''s Civilization V\CivilizationV_Tablet.exe'

## Install patch (Beyond Earth)

#### Linux (native)

⚠️ Mod support for the native Linux version seems to be broken; use Proton instead.

#### Linux (Proton)

Open a terminal and run these commands:

```
sed -i 's/SELECT ModID from Mods where Activated = 1/SELECT ModID from Mods where Activated = 2/' "/home/$USER/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/Sid Meier's Civilization Beyond Earth/CivilizationBE_DX11.exe"
sed -i 's/SELECT ModID from Mods where Activated = 1/SELECT ModID from Mods where Activated = 2/' "/home/$USER/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/Sid Meier's Civilization Beyond Earth/CivilizationBE_Mantle.exe"
```

#### Windows

Run these commands in PowerShell:

```
(Get-Content 'C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Sid Meier''s Civilization Beyond Earth\CivilizationBE_DX11.exe') | ForEach-Object { $_ -replace 'SELECT ModID from Mods where Activated = 1', 'SELECT ModID from Mods where Activated = 2' } | Set-Content 'C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Sid Meier''s Civilization Beyond Earth\CivilizationBE_DX11.exe'
(Get-Content 'C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Sid Meier''s Civilization Beyond Earth\CivilizationBE_Mantle.exe') | ForEach-Object { $_ -replace 'SELECT ModID from Mods where Activated = 1', 'SELECT ModID from Mods where Activated = 2' } | Set-Content 'C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Sid Meier''s Civilization Beyond Earth\CivilizationBE_Mantle.exe'
```
